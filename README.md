Hello! My name is Daniel Medina.
I currently have a Bachelors in Psychology, but I'm here now to pursue my original dream of software engineering, although I am also interested in learning Data Science/Analytics.
I am slowly but surely learning how to program with the classes I am taking at Codeacademy, having already completed their Basics of Javascript program and now continuing on
in their Computer Science Career Path to get a grip of some key topics in computer science and Python.
My goal is to make a living off of what I learn and find a feeling of fulfillment. In this GitHub account, I will be showcasing my current and future projects that I may do for my own fun
or to build a professional portfolio.
